# Tailscale Docker Forwarder

This project provides a Dockerized solution for forwarding network traffic between your local LAN and your Tailscale network, or vice-versa. It uses a macvlan network for each container instance to have its own IP on your LAN and utilizes `iptables` for fine-grained traffic manipulation. This setup allows running multiple forwarder instances, each configured for a distinct scenario.

**Docker Hub:** [menggatot/tailforwarder](https://hub.docker.com/r/menggatot/tailforwarder)

## Features

*   **Multiple Forwarding Scenarios**: Run separate container instances for different forwarding rules:
    *   **LAN to Tailscale Forwarding**: Access specific Tailscale node IPs (100.x.y.z) from your local network.
    *   **LAN to Advertised Tailscale Route**: Access IPs within routes advertised by other Tailscale nodes from your local network.
    *   **Tailscale to LAN Forwarding**: Expose services on your local LAN to your Tailscale network.
*   **Flexible Configuration**: Uses environment variables within `docker-compose.yml` to control forwarding rules, Tailscale settings (hostname, advertised routes/tags, accept routes), and `iptables` behavior per instance.
*   **Macvlan Integration**: Each instance operates with its own dedicated IP address on your LAN for seamless routing.
*   **Persistent Tailscale State**: Each instance saves its Tailscale node identity and state in a dedicated volume.
*   **Customizable Port Exclusion**: Specify TCP/UDP ports to exclude from LAN-to-Tailscale forwarding rules.
*   **Detailed Logging**: Scripts provide informative logs for setup and troubleshooting.

## Prerequisites

*   **Docker and Docker Compose:** Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed on your host machine (e.g., a Raspberry Pi, Linux server).
*   **Tailscale Account & Auth Key:** You'll need a Tailscale account and an Auth Key (`TS_AUTHKEY`) to authenticate the container as a Tailscale node.
*   **Host Physical Interface:** Identify the name of the physical network interface on your host machine connected to your LAN (e.g., `eth0`, `enp3s0`). This is crucial for the macvlan configuration.
*   **Available LAN IP:** Choose a static IP address on your LAN that is *not* currently in use and is outside your DHCP server's dynamic assignment range (or has a DHCP reservation). This IP will be assigned to the forwarder container.
*   **Understanding of LAN Configuration:** Basic knowledge of your LAN's subnet, gateway IP, and DNS settings.

## Installation and Setup

This guide assumes you will use the prebuilt image from Docker Hub.

1.  **Clone or Download:**
    If this project is in a Git repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <repository_directory>
    ```
    Or simply download the `docker-compose.yml` and `.env.example` files into a directory on your host.

2.  **Configure Global Environment Variables (primarily `TS_AUTHKEY`):**
    Copy the example environment file:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    Edit `.env` and set your `TS_AUTHKEY`:
    ```env
    # .env
    TS_AUTHKEY=tskey-your-auth-key-goes-here
    ```
    This `TS_AUTHKEY` will be used by all forwarder instances defined in `docker-compose.yml`.

3.  **Configure `docker-compose.yml`:**
    Open `docker-compose.yml`. The provided file is already structured for multiple instances (e.g., `tailforwarder-one`, `tailforwarder-two`, `tailforwarder-three`). You will need to:
    *   **Review Each Service Definition:**
        *   Adjust `hostname`, `container_name`, and `TS_HOSTNAME` if desired (though the defaults are usually fine).
        *   Ensure `TS_PEER_UDP_PORT` is unique for each service instance if they are running on the same host.
        *   Set the correct `ipv4_address` under `networks.macvlan_net` for each service. This IP must be unique on your LAN and suitable for your network configuration.
        *   Modify the scenario-specific environment variables for each service:
            *   For `ENABLE_LOCAL_TO_TS=true` instances (like `tailforwarder-one`, `tailforwarder-two`):
                *   Set `LISTEN_IP_ON_MACVLAN` to the same IP as `ipv4_address` for that service.
                *   Set `TARGET_TS_IP_FROM_LOCAL` to the target Tailscale IP or an IP in an advertised Tailscale route.
                *   For `tailforwarder-two` (LAN to advertised route), ensure `TS_ACCEPT_ROUTES=true`.
            *   For `ENABLE_TS_TO_LOCAL=true` instances (like `tailforwarder-three`):
                *   Set `DESTINATION_IP_FROM_TS` to the target local LAN IP you want to expose.
        *   Ensure the `volumes` path (e.g., `./tailscale_state_one`) is unique for each service to maintain separate Tailscale states.
    *   **Macvlan Network Configuration:**
        *   Adjust the `parent` interface in `networks.macvlan_net.driver_opts` to your host's physical LAN interface (e.g., `eth0`, `enp3s0`).
        *   Configure the `subnet` and `gateway` in `networks.macvlan_net.ipam.config` to match your LAN settings.

4.  **Start the Containers:**
    From the directory containing your `docker-compose.yml` and `.env` files, run:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

## Usage

Once the containers are running and Tailscale is connected in each:

*   **To check logs for a specific instance (e.g., `tailforwarder-one`):**
    ```bash
    docker-compose logs -f tailforwarder-one
    ```
    You should see logs from `entrypoint.sh` indicating Tailscale startup with the auth key, and then `iptables-config.sh` applying rules.

*   **Scenario Example: `tailforwarder-one` (Local LAN to specific Tailscale Node)**
    Assuming `tailforwarder-one` is configured with:
    *   `LISTEN_IP_ON_MACVLAN=10.10.0.10`
    *   `TARGET_TS_IP_FROM_LOCAL=100.x.y.z` (replace with actual Tailscale IP)
    *   If `100.x.y.z` has an SSH server on port 22, you can SSH to it from your LAN via `user@10.10.0.10`.

*   **Scenario Example: `tailforwarder-two` (Local LAN to Advertised Tailscale Route)**
    Assuming `tailforwarder-two` is configured with:
    *   `LISTEN_IP_ON_MACVLAN=10.10.0.20`
    *   `TARGET_TS_IP_FROM_LOCAL=192.168.A.B` (replace with an IP in an advertised route from another Tailscale node)
    *   `TS_ACCEPT_ROUTES=true`
    *   Devices on your LAN can access `192.168.A.B` by sending traffic to `10.10.0.20`.

*   **Scenario Example: `tailforwarder-three` (Tailscale to Local LAN)**
    Assuming `tailforwarder-three` is configured with:
    *   `TS_HOSTNAME=tailforwarder-three` (its Tailscale IP will be associated with this)
    *   `DESTINATION_IP_FROM_TS=10.10.0.50` (replace with actual local device IP)
    *   If `10.10.0.50` has a web server on port 80, devices on your Tailscale network can access it by browsing to `http://tailforwarder-three` (or its Tailscale IP).

## Environment Variables Overview

The primary method for configuration is through environment variables set directly in the `docker-compose.yml` file for each service, and `TS_AUTHKEY` set in the `.env` file.

### Global (from `.env` file)
*   `TS_AUTHKEY`: **(Required)** Your Tailscale authentication key. Used by all instances.

### Per-Instance (in `docker-compose.yml` under each service's `environment` section)

#### Core Tailscale Configuration (per instance)
*   `TS_HOSTNAME`: The hostname this specific container instance will use on the Tailscale network (e.g., `tailforwarder-one`).
*   `TS_ACCEPT_ROUTES`: Set to `true` if this instance should accept routes advertised by other Tailscale nodes. Essential for "LAN to Advertised Tailscale Route" scenarios.
*   `TS_USERSPACE`: Default `false`. Kernel mode is recommended.
*   `TS_STATE_DIR`: Default `/var/lib/tailscale`. Mapped to a unique host volume for each instance.
*   `TS_PEER_UDP_PORT`: A unique UDP port for each `tailscaled` instance if running multiple on the same host Docker engine (e.g., `41641`, `41642`, `41643`).
*   `TS_ROUTES` (formerly `TS_ROUTES_ADVERTISE`): Comma-separated local subnets this instance should advertise to Tailscale.
*   `TS_TAGS` (formerly `TS_TAGS_ADVERTISE`): Comma-separated tags for this instance on Tailscale.
*   `TS_EXTRA_ARGS`: Additional flags for the `tailscale up` command for this instance.

#### Network Configuration (for `iptables-config.sh`, per instance)
*   `MACVLAN_IFACE`: Typically `eth0` (the macvlan interface inside the container).

#### Scenario Configuration (per instance)

*   **For "Local LAN to Tailscale" (either direct or via advertised route):**
    *   `ENABLE_LOCAL_TO_TS`: Set to `true`.
    *   `LISTEN_IP_ON_MACVLAN`: The macvlan IP of *this* container instance (e.g., `10.10.0.10`). Traffic from your LAN to this IP will be forwarded.
    *   `TARGET_TS_IP_FROM_LOCAL`: The destination IP on the Tailscale network (e.g., `100.x.y.z` or an IP in an advertised subnet like `192.168.A.B`).
    *   `EXCLUDE_PORTS_TCP`: Comma-separated TCP ports to *exclude* from forwarding.
    *   `EXCLUDE_PORTS_UDP`: Comma-separated UDP ports to *exclude* from forwarding.
*   **For "Tailscale to Local LAN":**
    *   `ENABLE_TS_TO_LOCAL`: Set to `true`.
    *   `DESTINATION_IP_FROM_TS`: The actual IP address of the target device on your local LAN (e.g., `10.10.0.50`). Traffic sent to this container's Tailscale IP will be forwarded to this local IP.

Ensure `ENABLE_LOCAL_TO_TS` and `ENABLE_TS_TO_LOCAL` are set appropriately for each instance to avoid conflicting rules (typically one is `true` and the other `false` per instance).
